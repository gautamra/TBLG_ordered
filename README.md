# TBLG_ordered

This is the code used to perform the TRIQS-based DMFT simulations of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in the PRX journal article *[Dynamical correlations and order in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene](https://journals.aps.org/prx/accepted/8e072K39W0210c0ba7049de03c42d4dc07500afb4)* (to appear soon). A generalized and more user-friendly version of this code is available here: **WIP**.
